You
Okay, um. 

Isabella Iovino
Okay. 

You
Yeah, so like, I think that, uh, this. 

Isabella Iovino
I think that little rectangle could be like, something could customize, someone could customize like a background photo theme for their posts individually or maybe just for their overall page, like anytime you click on one other posts, that photo's there. 

You
Okay. 

Isabella Iovino
But they could also maybe make it, like, just customizable. I don't know. 

You
Um, okay. So do you like this idea still? Like this is the giant square in the center? Okay, 

Isabella Iovino
Yeah. 

You
and then anything on the what do you want on the bottom? 

Isabella Iovino
Then likes and comments can go there in like the caption. 

You
Okay, so then this is likes. So, okay, we have a cat. Oh damn, that's not what I wanted. So we have uh, This is... Um, caption. Caption first. Ah. 

Isabella Iovino
Do we want to have the handle somewhere here? 

You
It could just still be at the top if you want, like this. Because you're going from this screen to this screen. You know? 

Isabella Iovino
Yeah. Because also you gotta think about how when you're looking at like random posts like on the Explorer page or something. It's gonna, like, you're gonna want to know, like, who the account is. 

You
Okay. 

Isabella Iovino
You know? So, you gotta make it somewhat similar to that. 

You
Alright. Uh let's see. Handle. 

Isabella Iovino
Yeah, that works. 

You
And some. So what would you describe this space here? As. 

Isabella Iovino
Uh, maybe somebody could put, like, just write whatever there. Maybe not necessarily the caption, but it's like something different. I don't know They could write whatever they want there or like put a photo with it or maybe even draw something. 

You
Interesting. 

Isabella Iovino
I don't 

You
Um, 

Isabella Iovino
know. 

You
So like custom space, custom, uh, Art space. I 

Isabella Iovino
Yeah. We'll do that 

You
guess, 

Isabella Iovino
for now. 

You
uh, Drawing, Photo, text, quote, something like that. Um, 

Isabella Iovino
Yeah. 

You
how is this should be like uh, like kind of this big and like centered like this or do you, you know, uh, what does this look like, you know? 

Isabella Iovino
Uh, maybe a little smaller, but like centered still. 

You
Okay. Um, 

Isabella Iovino
No, just like from the bottom right corner, just like draw it in. 

You
Oh, like not, uh. 

Isabella Iovino
And like shorter a little. 

You
Like, uh, 

Isabella Iovino
No, 

You
I gotta 

Isabella Iovino
up, 

You
make 

Isabella Iovino
yeah. 

You
the size a little smaller, I think. Size of the text. It's like 

Isabella Iovino
There 

You
like 

Isabella Iovino
you go. 

You
that, like a half of the screen. 

Isabella Iovino
No, that's like, that's too like compact. Like, I want it to be longer and shorter. 

You
Longer and shorter, so like like that. 

Isabella Iovino
Yeah, but like a little shorter. Yeah, like that. 

You
Oh, 

Isabella Iovino
And 

You
it's 

Isabella Iovino
then 

You
like 

Isabella Iovino
center 

You
3 quarters 

Isabella Iovino
it. 

You
of screen. Oh, okay, okay. Okay. This still center, right? 

Isabella Iovino
Maybe, 

You
Okay. 

Isabella Iovino
maybe draw. Yeah, maybe drag it down a little bit. Mm, like there. 

You
Okay. It's 

Isabella Iovino
Hmm. 

You
got good spacing. Um... Yeah. What 

Isabella Iovino
Where are we going to put like the settings tab on the homepage or profile page? 

You
do you even want in settings? 

Isabella Iovino
Um, 

You
Hold 

Isabella Iovino
Time 

You
on, look. 

Isabella Iovino
limit. 

You
Before 

Isabella Iovino
Huh? 

You
we get into that, before we get into settings, let's make settings last, all right? Um, We still need to create post page and like, what is, what's the, what's left on this one? You need a caption, you need uh, Likes. How do people like? And 

Isabella Iovino
Uh, just 

You
comment. 

Isabella Iovino
double tap. 

You
Same thing is, okay. Uh, likes, okay, what does this show? Does this show something different for the user and for a person viewing this page? 

Isabella Iovino
Maybe, wait, maybe the likes could go, well. Shit. 

You
Captain, I don't know where it likes though yet. This comments is like right here, I guess. 

Isabella Iovino
Maybe, maybe the handle needs to be like to the left of the caption, like how an Instagram is. 

You
Left on the caption. Are you really, you want it down here still? 

Isabella Iovino
Maybe. 

You
Ah 

Isabella Iovino
Nah, never mind. 

You
I 

Isabella Iovino
Where the 

You

Isabella Iovino
hell's 

You

Isabella Iovino
the 

You
you mean. 

Isabella Iovino
likes gonna 

You
I 

Isabella Iovino
go? 

You
see what you mean. 

Isabella Iovino
Maybe the, maybe the likes can go in between the custom art thing and the box, the photo? 

You
Oh, like here? What, 

Isabella Iovino
Yeah. 

You
I mean, I don't even know what this looks like. Uh, 

Isabella Iovino
Yeah. 

You
You know, they have icons. You know, and uh, You know, like anytime you want to look at the comments, you have to click this comments. There's a comments modal that pops up. Uh, 

Isabella Iovino
Yeah. 

You
And uh, 

Isabella Iovino
Yeah, maybe make it, so you have to click on something to see the captions, because I don't want it to look 

You
Okay. 

Isabella Iovino
so busy. 

You
Um, Wait, to see the caption or to see the comment? 

Isabella Iovino
No, to see the 

You
Okay, 

Isabella Iovino
comments, to see the comments. 

You
okay, so let's let's get rid of that. You you kind of, are you, we're trying to like mimic Instagram a bit here. I 

Isabella Iovino
Yeah. 

You
think. So like, okay, the caption is here. Uh, And 

Isabella Iovino
Mm-hmm. 

You
then, uh, we have, Let's see, small little, let's do this. Let's do like. 

Isabella Iovino
What's that? 

You
So it's supposed to be an icon. Uh, 

Isabella Iovino
For what? 

You
You can have... Like a like button here. And then the comments button here. And then, uh, 

Isabella Iovino
I want the caption to go above the comments though. Right? 

You
Well, you should, 

Isabella Iovino
Well. 

You
well, The comments would open 

Isabella Iovino
Okay, 

You
up 

Isabella Iovino
yeah, 

You
in 

Isabella Iovino
yeah. 

You
them, like they do Instagram, 

Isabella Iovino
Yeah. 

You
I guess, like you open up the modal and you got a bunch of comments. 

Isabella Iovino
Yeah. 

You
Uh, Let's see, um, You want a date? 

Isabella Iovino
Uh, where would that go? 

You
I mean, it's it's, uh, it's here. It's not as big, but that's where it is. 

Isabella Iovino
Okay, that works. 

You
Um. I mean, do you want to show like who liked it? 

Isabella Iovino
Uh, yeah, like you could click on it to see who liked it. Like the. 

You
How do you do? Oh, like, you 

Isabella Iovino
Uh. 

You
have to say others, you have to click others. And it comes up with 

Isabella Iovino
Or 

You
the likes. 

Isabella Iovino
just. Or just maybe, like, it'll say likes. Or liked by. 

You
Okay. 

Isabella Iovino
Or wait, Instagram says liked by. I don't want to be copying Instagram completely. 

You
So 

Isabella Iovino
Uh, 

You
so this button. 

Isabella Iovino
hearted 

You
This 

Isabella Iovino
by. 

You
button likes 

Isabella Iovino
Loved 

You

Isabella Iovino

You
photo. Okay. All right, so this button. Actually, I mean, this is just another way to like it. But 

Isabella Iovino
Yeah. 

You
obviously you can just double tap the picture, but uh, um, 

Isabella Iovino
Mm-hmm. 

You
Comments here. Uh, and then you want. We'll move this down a bit and we'll put the, uh, this also 

Isabella Iovino

Isabella Iovino
too 

You
to, 

Isabella Iovino
much. 

You
it doesn't have to be this big. I'm just like trying to 

Isabella Iovino
Okay. 

You
organize it here. Um, so this is like this is your likes. It's like you, 

Isabella Iovino
Hmm. 

You

Isabella Iovino
Yeah. 

You
That's where it is. You know, like 

Isabella Iovino
Yeah. 

You
what we say here is. 

Isabella Iovino
Well, doesn't it say it above the likes? Like the like button? 

You
There's a light button, there's a heart button. 

Isabella Iovino
Oh, I see. 

You
Um, I mean, you know, then you can. I mean, did you want this to be multipost too? Like we can have the dots here. Uh, 

Isabella Iovino
Um. Yeah, maybe make it like. The dots. Hmm. 

You
Let's see. I do this. Uh, I'll do this, I'm gonna do this. So you can make this a little bit smaller. Okay, um. Scrib 

Isabella Iovino
You got the 

You
this. 

Isabella Iovino
likes at the 

You
Where 

Isabella Iovino
top still. 

You
do you want the likes? 

Isabella Iovino
I think the bottom's better. 

You
Like uh here? 

Isabella Iovino
No, like how it was, but I'm saying, like, look at the top of the screen, you have the likes button still 

You
Oh, 

Isabella Iovino
there. 

You
oh. Okay. It's 

Isabella Iovino
Where you just deleted it. 

You
right here. 

Isabella Iovino
What? No, go back. Like, I liked how it was at the bottom, but I'm just letting you know 

You
Oh, 

Isabella Iovino
you have it at the top too. 

You
okay. 

Isabella Iovino
Like move the likes that you have at the bottom, you had it above the caption before. 

You
I thought, yeah, that's what I, okay. Oh, 

Isabella Iovino
Yeah. 

You
you just want this to get going. 

Isabella Iovino
Yeah. 

You
Okay, gotcha. Okay. All right. Um, let's do little small circles. What 

Isabella Iovino
I don't want it to be a circle. 

You
can it be then? 

Isabella Iovino
Well, actually, for the sliding thing, that's fine, but I'm talking about like the like and common button. What are we gonna make that look like? 

You
Icons. Uh. 

Isabella Iovino
Well, yeah, but like, what do we want it to look like? 

You
12nd, let me use this. I don't know what that sound is. 

Isabella Iovino
Yeah, what the hell is it? 

You
Okay, um. I feel like this is just something. I mean, maybe this is fine. Maybe it'll be bitter 

Isabella Iovino
Yeah. 

You
like when we get something real 

Isabella Iovino
You 

You
there, 

Isabella Iovino
got 

You
but. 

Isabella Iovino
to make a 5th dot because it's going to allow you to do 5 photos. 

You
Okay. Um. 

Isabella Iovino
Or should it be 6 or 

You
No, 

Isabella Iovino
7? 

You
it's five. It's five. That's it. Five. No. 

Isabella Iovino
Six, seven. Huh. Those circles look funny. 

You
Yep, they do. 

Isabella Iovino
I 

You
Yeah. 

Isabella Iovino
like squiggly. 

You
All right, yeah. I mean, don't worry about this too much. It's going to 

Isabella Iovino
Yeah. 

You
be an icon. Um, All right, so, I mean, this is like the like button. I don't even know if I can get the text that small, but like, like, I just put an L. I can't even get it that small. Okay, forget it. Okay. 

Isabella Iovino
Yeah, just leave it for now. 

You
All right, um, how are we with spacing here? So it's, uh, 

Isabella Iovino
I think that spacing's fine. Yeah, that's good. 

You
All 

Isabella Iovino
Then 

You
right, 

Isabella Iovino
the 

You
so that's 

Isabella Iovino
top. 

You
that's your postscreen. 

Isabella Iovino
Yeah. 

You
Um, 

Isabella Iovino
And then you need 

You
Yeah, 

Isabella Iovino
a back button. 

You
don't worry about that too much. Like, that can be, that's kind of part of the system in a way. Um, All right, so. Like the navigation part is separate. right? Well, we'll worry about that when it comes to it. Like we're, 

Isabella Iovino
Yeah. 

You
um, Okay. 

Isabella Iovino
Okay, back to the home page. Because 

You
Right, 

Isabella Iovino
we don't have anything for that really. 

You
so 

Isabella Iovino
Why 

You
we 

Isabella Iovino
is 

You
have. 

Isabella Iovino
it looking 

You
Okay, 

Isabella Iovino
rectangular? That's the profile. 

You
profile post screen, search screen. Where's this name of app thing? Do you want that on the feet? Or 

Isabella Iovino
Oh, 

You
do 

Isabella Iovino
yeah, 

You
you 

Isabella Iovino
I 

You
want 

Isabella Iovino
want 

You
me 

Isabella Iovino
that 

You
to get rid 

Isabella Iovino
like 

You
of 

Isabella Iovino
on 

You
that? 

Isabella Iovino
the, I want it like on every page except for just the profile page. 

You
All right, so profile, post screen handle, handle, search screen. You want the name of app. 

Isabella Iovino
Yeah. 

You
Okay, let's put that here. I move that shit down. Got rid of this last course. This last row, I guess. It's 

Isabella Iovino
What's that at the bottom right corner you have there? 

You
a search button. It's 

Isabella Iovino
Oh, 

You
like that's kind of 

Isabella Iovino
it's not 

You
where 

Isabella Iovino
going 

You
it's 

Isabella Iovino
to be like 

You
going to 

Isabella Iovino
a 

You
show up. 

Isabella Iovino
bar. 

You
It will be a bar, but that's that's 

Isabella Iovino
Or. 

You
where it shows on the on the bar. Um, 

Isabella Iovino
Oh. 

You
All right, so, name of app. Okay, we have this is the feed screen. All right, so, okay. 

Isabella Iovino
So this is 

You
Oops. 

Isabella Iovino
like people's posts. So how are we gonna like showcase their. Okay, so I have an idea. So. So their post. Wait, what are you doing? 

You
I'm just doing like, just making 

Isabella Iovino
Oh, 

You
a 

Isabella Iovino
okay. 

You
mental note of like things we still have to do. So like, um, comments, modal. Uh, likes modal. Do you want to you want to show like who liked it? 

Isabella Iovino
Uh. Yeah. 

You
Okay. So that's gonna go, um, It's gonna go over here. Like when you click those diesel show. Um, Okay. 

Isabella Iovino
Okay. So go back to the home screen where you show everyone's posts. 

You
Right here. Go ahead. 

Isabella Iovino
The people you follow. So I think like make it square. 

You
Which one? Like 

Isabella Iovino
That. 

You
this. 

Isabella Iovino
Yeah. That's supposed to be square because that's like what the post is gonna 

You
Everything 

Isabella Iovino
be. 

You
square. 

Isabella Iovino
Why 

You
Oh, 

Isabella Iovino
do you... are you making 

You
oh, 

Isabella Iovino
it smaller? 

You
I don't know, I don't know. I don't know. I'll make it square. 

Isabella Iovino
Okay, 

You
Do 

Isabella Iovino
all 

You
you do 

Isabella Iovino
right, 

You
you 

Isabella Iovino
that 

You
want 

Isabella Iovino
was 

You
it? 

Isabella Iovino
good. 

You
Okay, okay. 

Isabella Iovino
So then what I'm thinking is at the very top, not like in the post itself, do like another rectangle at the very top of that, that's, it's gonna be like connected to it. 

You
Another 

Isabella Iovino
to the 

You
rectangle 

Isabella Iovino
post, but 

You
in. 

Isabella Iovino
it's, at the very top, like a very skinny rectangle at the top. like right above it. 

You
Like that? Oh, 

Isabella Iovino
Above the post. 

You
above the post. 

Isabella Iovino
No, not that, not that, not that skinny. Just like, like maybe, 

You
Okay, 

Isabella Iovino
like, 

You
okay. Okay, 

Isabella Iovino
okay. A 

You
that. 

Isabella Iovino
little bigger, a little more. More, more. That's good. Okay, and then I want it to be like attached to that. And that's where it's gonna show the person's handle and like their profile photo that you're 

You
Handle 

Isabella Iovino
seeing. 

You
and profile photo. Oh. 

Isabella Iovino
Yep. 

You
Um, okay, 

Isabella Iovino
And it's like 

You
so, 

Isabella Iovino
attached 

You
maybe 

Isabella Iovino
to the post. 

You
we just do that. You want a square, separate square, you know, because you want, hold on. 

Isabella Iovino
I want it to be the same square, but it's like separated by a line, basically. And it's good, like, so technically it'll be more like a rectangle, but the actual post itself is a square, but like, 

You
The 

Isabella Iovino
that, 

You
post itself 

Isabella Iovino
is 

You
is 

Isabella Iovino
like, 

You
a square. So then this is like kind of attached to the post still. 

Isabella Iovino
Yeah, 

You
Um, 

Isabella Iovino
yeah. 

You
like, kind of like that, like, same size. Um, 

Isabella Iovino
Yep. 

You
And Inside 

Isabella Iovino
And then, uh, 

You
this 

Isabella Iovino
the, 

You
then, like you want to have like another rectangle here, like of the actual, like, like kind of 

Isabella Iovino
Yeah. 

You
like that. Um, 

Isabella Iovino
Yep. 

You
of the picture, oops. 

Isabella Iovino
Yep. I wonder what that is. 

You
I'm gonna probably. 

Isabella Iovino
Dang, my phone's at 

You
All 

Isabella Iovino
6%. 

You
right. So this is like handle. Yeah, and profile photo. Okay. 

Isabella Iovino
And then the, uh, The likes and comments. 

You
Yeah, how do you want do you want to show that kind of like how this is? 

Isabella Iovino
Yeah, I basically, I want it like that, but then instead of like not being able to scroll, like how you can't scroll on someone's profile, you can still scroll so you can see other friends posts. 

You
So, Um, 

Isabella Iovino
So we're dropping that, like that, that whole custom art thing, that's not going to be a thing where when you're on 

You
Okay, 

Isabella Iovino
the home screen. 

You
so I can basically copy like everything here, right? Um, 

Isabella Iovino
Yeah. 

You
Let's make that a group. Uh, duplicate that, bring it over here. And get what it is, and we'll put that there. 

Isabella Iovino
Yep 

You
You 

Isabella Iovino
there you go. 

You
like that spacing on the sides too? 

Isabella Iovino
Um, Maybe let it take up the whole screen. 

You
Okay. Um, I hope I can just do that. That'd be cool. Yeah, it looks like a can. Okay. Um. And that's the fee. I mean, I can just put this. I mean, they're not 

Isabella Iovino
And 

You
gonna... 

Isabella Iovino
then you can just keep scrolling through posts of people who post. Should we do stories? 

You
No. Oh, 

Isabella Iovino
Uh. 

You
I don't know. I mean, could be, okay, we need MVP. Right? What's that? Uh, 

Isabella Iovino
What's 

You
minimum, 

Isabella Iovino
that? 

You
minimum viable product. Meaning 

Isabella Iovino
What does that mean? 

You
the minimum amount to get this thing just on the App Store. Like, 

Isabella Iovino
What do you 

You
is 

Isabella Iovino
mean, 

You
it 

Isabella Iovino
the 

You
work? 

Isabella Iovino
minimum amount of what? 

You
It's 

Isabella Iovino
Huh? 

You
like minimum amount of work, the minimum viable product. It's 

Isabella Iovino
What does 

You
like 

Isabella Iovino
that 

You
what, 

Isabella Iovino
mean? 

You
it's just the minimum amount of features that you need to get done to just go and launch it. Right, 

Isabella Iovino
Oh, okay. Uh, so you need the settings. 

You
we'll get there. Hold on. Uh, 

Isabella Iovino
And you also need like the search bar page. Like when you actually click on the search and then like when you're searching, which that'll be pretty simple. 

You
Um, Why does it seem like? I was grouped and I can't ungroup this. I 

Isabella Iovino
Just 

You
don't 

Isabella Iovino
leave 

You
know 

Isabella Iovino
it 

You
why. 

Isabella Iovino
for now. 

You
Hold on, ungroup. There we go. And then, uh, Come on. Give me that. And then that, and then going to group that. Okay. 

Isabella Iovino
Wait, why'd you 

You
What 

Isabella Iovino
separate it? 

You
do you mean? No, I'm 

Isabella Iovino
Oh, 

You
just, 

Isabella Iovino
never 

You
I'm 

Isabella Iovino
mind. 

You
trying to group it. That's it. And I'm gonna group that with that. So I can kind of just move this whole thing up a little bit. That's 

Isabella Iovino
Okay. 

You
where you want. 

Isabella Iovino
What's gonna go at the very bottom there? 

You
Uh, Tampa. 

Isabella Iovino
Because I don't 

You
Tampa. 

Isabella Iovino
want it to be, huh? Oh, yeah, okay. 

You
You can probably 

Isabella Iovino
So, 

You
do. 

Isabella Iovino
I guess for the tab bar, let's create the, like, the home screen and then the the profile and then the search. 

You
Home screen. Right. 

Isabella Iovino
So the home screen is the one we're on now. 

You
Make this a little bigger, okay. Yeah, bar. Why did it show there? There you go. All right. Go ahead. But I 

Isabella Iovino
Um, 

You
don't 

Isabella Iovino
and 

You
know. 

Isabella Iovino
then You gotta do the tab bar at the bottom of the other pages. Well, shit, wait. If you're doing the tab bar at the bottom, you gotta do it, like, how are you gonna do it at the bottom when you have the search bar there? 

You
Oh, 

Isabella Iovino
For the 

You
it's, 

Isabella Iovino
search page? 

You
this is, this is gonna be inside the tab bar. Like, it's gonna be, 

Isabella Iovino
Oh 

You
uh, 

Isabella Iovino
okay. 

You
I can dynamically change it. 

Isabella Iovino
Yeah, maybe make it like, so it's right above the tab bar, like at the center. 

You
Like you can just, I got to show you an app that does it alone. 

Isabella Iovino
Because I don't I don't want it to be part of the tab bar, because that might get confusing. I don't know. 

You
It's pretty, let me see if I can find you an example app. Um, Like his, 

Isabella Iovino
Like 

You
okay, 

Isabella Iovino
the 

You
this black. 

Isabella Iovino
App Store, I 

You
Here's 

Isabella Iovino
know, does it at the bottom? 

You
a. 

Isabella Iovino
Yes. 

You
Uh. Oh, the App Store does it? 

Isabella Iovino
They have a, yeah, they have it at the bottom and also the 

You
Yeah, 

Isabella Iovino
settings. 

You
that's exactly what I mean. Like, you have a certain, like, just a search. 

Isabella Iovino
Yes, but you see how it's at the bottom there? Like, you're gonna have the tab bar there as well. So maybe make this tab bar right below that search bar. 

You
That bar 

Isabella Iovino
Because 

You

You
Home search and well, okay. That's, that's different than, All right. That's the tab icon to. Go to the screen. 

Isabella Iovino
Yes, but then look, search bar goes right above it. Like when you're in, when you're on the search page, the explorer page where there's all this post, right at the bottom above, the magnifying glass is going to be a search bar. 

You
Okay. 

Isabella Iovino
It's not actually going to say search bar, but it's going to be like maybe a bar that it's like type here or something. 

You
Okay, 

Isabella Iovino
Just 

You
so 

Isabella Iovino
kind 

You
like, 

Isabella Iovino
of at the 

You
And 

Isabella Iovino
center. 

You
that's that's 

Isabella Iovino
Because 

You
what this 

Isabella Iovino
there's. 

You
thing does. Like you click, go to the App Store, click on it and like, oh, okay, I know what you mean now. I see what you're saying. 

Isabella Iovino
Yeah. 

You
Okay, hold on. That is configurable with that. So like, I got to give you another app. hold on. Um, Like, I should just record this, so on. I'll show you. Okay. There you go. Send this to you. 

Isabella Iovino

Isabella Iovino
Slack. 

You
Yeah, that's that's it's a Slack app. But that, 

Isabella Iovino
What does 

You
that's 

Isabella Iovino
it 

You
what 

Isabella Iovino
do? 

You
they, It's for company stuff, but like, just a tab bar. You just watch the tab bar interaction. 

Isabella Iovino
Okay, I see what you mean, but I don't like that. I like just having the search bar. 

You
See how it comes 

Isabella Iovino
I 

You
up 

Isabella Iovino
don't 

You
when 

Isabella Iovino
know. 

You
you press it, it's like, okay, you search and 

Isabella Iovino
Yeah, I 

You
it just comes up right where you... 

Isabella Iovino
I see that, but like, then you would have to change the whole like tab bar at the bottom and I don't want to be doing that. have to move it over. Because there's also see how there's such a big gap in between the bottom, on the search page. Like, I feel like it could fit. I don't know, you could make it both ways and we'll see which one looks better. 

You
Okay. Like I will say, okay, all right. It's, 

Isabella Iovino
What? 

You
it's fun, it's like that's easier to do. It looks complicated, but that's easier to do than what we're trying to do. So, that's 

Isabella Iovino
Wait, the way 

You
the 

Isabella Iovino
you want 

You
only reason 

Isabella Iovino
to do 

You
why I 

Isabella Iovino
it's 

You
bring it 

Isabella Iovino
easier? 

You
up. Yeah. It's 

Isabella Iovino
How was 

You
just, 

Isabella Iovino
that easier? 

You
it's already configured. It's like, it's something that I can just like, I can write like 2 or 3 lines of code and it's already built. 

Isabella Iovino
Well, I don't want it to be easier. I want it to be perfect. 

You
Wow. All 

Isabella Iovino
So, 

You
right, 

Isabella Iovino
I 

You
MVP. 

Isabella Iovino
mean, you can try it. 

You
I think that, okay, all right, all right. 

Isabella Iovino
Try it your way and then try it the way I'm talking about and then we'll see which one looks better. 

You

Isabella Iovino
And 

You

Isabella Iovino

You
tamp bar is like, you're gonna have, uh,
