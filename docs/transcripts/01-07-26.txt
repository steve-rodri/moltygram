You
All right. Okay, user logs in and opens app. They see. What screen? Like, what do you want to see on? Oh, is this shit? 

Isabella Iovino
Hmm, maybe, like... Hmm. It's kind of hard, because I don't want it to be, like, a copycat of Instagram, but I want it to be, like, something along those lines, you know? 

You
Yeah. 

Isabella Iovino
So, maybe. Maybe when it opens up, you open up to your profile rather than opening up to like the homepage where it's showing everyone post. 

You
Uh, okay, so like profile screen. Um. You know? Okay, yeah, let's just let's just do this. lets go with this. So profile screen. What does that look like? 

Isabella Iovino
Uh, there's going to be a profile photo. 

You
It's 

Isabella Iovino
Uh, 

You
like right 

Isabella Iovino
let's 

You
here. 

Isabella Iovino
make it 

You
Okay. 

Isabella Iovino
square. 

You
I 

Isabella Iovino
Or should it be Circle? What do you think? 

You
don't care. Uh, 

Isabella Iovino
Hmm. 

You
or like a rounded circle, like, like that. 

Isabella Iovino
Ooh, what if, what if you can make it customizable? So like someone could choose their profile photo to be like shaped like a star or like a square or 

You
Could 

Isabella Iovino
circle. 

You
do that, yeah. Okay. 

Isabella Iovino
Um, yeah, it was too square for now. 

You
Customize. I'm already, I don't know why I take notes on that. It's already been recording. Okay. Um, square for now, it's cool. It's like in the center or like here or like. 

Isabella Iovino
Hmm. Let's see the right side. 

You
Like 

Isabella Iovino
Hmm. 

You
in here or kind of like in here. You know what I mean? I 

Isabella Iovino
Man. Because like, I'm not trying to copy Instagram. It's like, 

You
know. I 

Isabella Iovino
It's hard 

You
mean, 

Isabella Iovino
to come 

You
it's 

Isabella Iovino
up 

You
okay, 

Isabella Iovino
with 

You
you 

Isabella Iovino
something. 

You
know what it is? It's not that bad to copy because you're just basically reducing features. Like you're taking a lot of stuff that works already. It's fun. 

Isabella Iovino
Yeah, that's true. Um. Okay, let's keep it like that and then. Maybe the handle could be... Huh. Like underneath it? No. 

You
Oh, you need like a handle, right? Like because they 

Isabella Iovino
Yeah. 

You
have like this and 

Isabella Iovino
I 

You
then. 

Isabella Iovino
want it to be, I want it to be so that, like, you know how Instagram the bio takes up like a 3rd of the screen. 

You
Let 

Isabella Iovino
I 

You
me 

Isabella Iovino
don't want 

You
look 

Isabella Iovino
it 

You
at 

Isabella Iovino
to be 

You
it. 

Isabella Iovino
that 

You
Let 

Isabella Iovino
much. I 

You
me look 

Isabella Iovino
want it 

You
at 

Isabella Iovino
to 

You
Instagram. 

Isabella Iovino
be like very small, so you could see the person's like posts more than that. 

You
Okay, so Instagram is like the, this is on the left side and then um, Actually, they have like a header with the tag up here. I 

Isabella Iovino
Yeah. 

You
mean, just put some elements on the screen real quick, so like we have, uh, just another box here. That's like, And this is the, the, handle. So that's, oops. So that's Um, What 

Isabella Iovino
Or maybe 

You
is some? 

Isabella Iovino
actually 

You
Okay. 

Isabella Iovino
the name of the app should go up there. You know, you know how Instagram does that? 

You
Name of app. Uh. 

Isabella Iovino
And then the handle goes right next to the. Yeah. 

You
And what goes right next to the photo, like that? 

Isabella Iovino
Yeah. 

You
And 

Isabella Iovino
Yeah. 

You
you still want it on this side or just? Okay. 

Isabella Iovino
Uh, I think I like the left. And then maybe in between the, oh, what just happened? 

You
Ah, 

Isabella Iovino
Studying 

You
ah. Ah. 

Isabella Iovino
visas? Crypto stock, whatever 

You
It. 

Isabella Iovino
that was. 

You
Ah. Mom. 

Isabella Iovino
Who's laughing at you? Was that Mog 

You
Yeah. 

Isabella Iovino
Coin? Jesus. 

You
Come on. Okay, I don't know what that sound is. 

Isabella Iovino
How do you wait, how do you how do you make it go back to the square? 

You
I was trying to undo. 

Isabella Iovino
Okay. 

You
Yeah, that's 

Isabella Iovino
Oh, 

You
that's 

Isabella Iovino
okay. 

You
why I got screwed 

Isabella Iovino
All right, so 

You
up. 

Isabella Iovino
the handle can go there and then I don't know if I want to show follower count. 

You
Hmm. 

Isabella Iovino
Maybe like show. Okay, maybe instead of having the follower count, because like, so nobody's focusing on like how many followers someone has, 

You
Yeah. 

Isabella Iovino
just put like followers so that people can like see who the other person's following to see if you have mutuals, you know? 

You
Okay. 

Isabella Iovino
Instead of showing the number, just put followers and following. 

You
Okay, followers. And following. Oh, so it's like just a button, just 2 buttons. 

Isabella Iovino
Yeah. 

You
Okay, um. It's just, they're too big now, Bell. Following button. I 

Isabella Iovino
I mean, 

You
wonder, 

Isabella Iovino
you can 

You
I'm 

Isabella Iovino
adjust 

You
gonna 

Isabella Iovino
the 

You
do... 

Isabella Iovino
size of it, 

You
Yeah. 

Isabella Iovino
like. Through the actual 

You
Yeah, 

Isabella Iovino
thing. 

You
I'm trying to figure that out now. Uh. Small. followers button. It's gonna be too... I gotta like make the uh, the whole thing a little bit bigger here. 

Isabella Iovino
Maybe maybe don't even do the name of app, maybe. I don't know. What do you think? 

You
That's fine. It's like branding. Like, it's just like, 

Isabella Iovino
Yeah, that's 

You
uh, 

Isabella Iovino
true. 

You
I don't know. I 

Isabella Iovino
Wait, 

You
mean, 

Isabella Iovino
let 

You
I've 

Isabella Iovino
me look 

You
done that. 

Isabella Iovino
at 

You
They 

Isabella Iovino
Instagram. 

You
don't have that, but uh, it's fine. 

Isabella Iovino
They have it like, oh, okay, so the center at the top is actually the handle, and then the name is like right next to the photo. 

You
Um... Following button. It's just kind of annoying to do. All right, I'm just going to take that button here. Too big. I know what it is. Um, Actually, just do that. Following. That's pretty, that's, uh... 

Isabella Iovino
I think it looks okay, but I want I want it closer to the top. 

You
Okay. 

Isabella Iovino
Like, because I want, I want the bio to be as little space as possible. Or maybe maybe that gap could have like a little bio. Like somebody could write something 

You
Like 

Isabella Iovino
or should it go underneath the photo? 

You
here? No, 

Isabella Iovino
Yeah. 

You
it's 

Isabella Iovino
Or 

You
probably, 

Isabella Iovino
should it 

You
I 

Isabella Iovino
go? Yeah. 

You
think it's, I mean, that's kind of what I don't know. You also have to, like, realize that you can't be like completely different from Instagram, 

Isabella Iovino
Yeah, 

You
because 

Isabella Iovino
you're right. You're right. 

You
I 

Isabella Iovino
Yeah. 

You
don't know. It's the feeling thing. 

Isabella Iovino
I think the 

You
People are used 

Isabella Iovino
handle. 

You
to certain things. 

Isabella Iovino
Yeah, I think the handle should actually go above the followers I'm following. 

You
Okay. So don't 

Isabella Iovino
So like flip 

You
do this. 

Isabella Iovino
them. 

You
And you kind of just 

Isabella Iovino
Now 

You
like, 

Isabella Iovino
there's too 

You
Like 

Isabella Iovino
much of a gap. 

You
this. Or 

Isabella Iovino
Mm. 

You
like. 

Isabella Iovino
No, move it 

You
Like 

Isabella Iovino
up. 

You
this. 

Isabella Iovino
Oh, okay, okay. Move the handle up like that, and then the bio could go right underneath followers and following, 

You
Okay, 

Isabella Iovino
like someone could write something if they want. 

You
so we'll do. Like that. And. 

Isabella Iovino
And then maybe above the picture could be like, however, whatever they want to put as their name. 

You
Above the picture. What is their 

Isabella Iovino
Yeah. 

You
name? Oh. 

Isabella Iovino
Like, so you know how like you can put your name in Instagram, but like they're handled separate from 

You
Yeah. 

Isabella Iovino
that? Yeah, so maybe like the name could go above. Or should it go right next to the handle where that gap is? 

You
Um... Let's see, uh, They have the handle. Okay, so the handle is at the top, Instagram, and then they have the name. Like, ends with the, like, data next to the image, um, Bio handle. Should you just do this? Oh shit. How do I lock this? I lock that one. Okay. She, you want to just do this? 

Isabella Iovino
But that's like exactly like 

You
I 

Isabella Iovino
Instagram, isn't it? 

You
know. I know. 

Isabella Iovino
So, 

You
All 

Isabella Iovino
I don't know. I'm trying 

You
right. 

Isabella Iovino
to keep 

You
Okay. 

Isabella Iovino
like the that part of the profile as little as possible because one thing that I find kind of annoying about Instagram is how big that part is because I like to see the photos more than 

You
What 

Isabella Iovino
the 

You
if we, what 

Isabella Iovino
actual. 

You
if we did that? 

Isabella Iovino
Mm. Ooh, what if followers is on the left of name of app and following on the right? 

You
You could do 

Isabella Iovino
That 

You
that. 

Isabella Iovino
might look 

You
It 

Isabella Iovino
weird. 

You
could do this too, like um, up here in the top right or something. 

Isabella Iovino
Yeah. 

You
I think this could be a separate section, though. Like, you don't have to put this, like, this is like your your, like, information. Um, 

Isabella Iovino
Yeah. And then maybe 

You
Yeah. 

Isabella Iovino
the name could go right underneath handle there. 

You
Could be name 1st or handle first. 

Isabella Iovino
Uh. Should, I don't know. Oh, what if, what if the handle is like in the profile photo, like at the bottom of it, 

You
Yeah, 

Isabella Iovino
or 

You
I could 

Isabella Iovino
the 

You
do that. 

Isabella Iovino
name? No, actually, I feel like the name would probably be cooler, because, like, people could customize it to whatever they want, you know? 

You
I 

Isabella Iovino
Actually, I don't 

You
mean, 

Isabella Iovino
know. 

You
they can do both. They can customize the handle in it. I mean, you know, I don't know why 

Isabella Iovino
That's 

You
you 

Isabella Iovino
true. 

You
have a handle in a name. I 

Isabella Iovino
Yeah. 

You
mean, you can just put your name in the bio. If you want to. All 

Isabella Iovino
No, I want to have the name section. 

You
right. 

Isabella Iovino
And then also maybe next to it, you could put pronouns. 

You
Right. Like, so here you'd have. Pronouns here. 

Isabella Iovino
Yeah. 

You
All right. Um. 

Isabella Iovino
And maybe the maybe the handle, it could be like longer, so it like, it's like not just awkwardly kind of there, you know, like that, yeah. 

You
Okay. 

Isabella Iovino
Okay. 

You
Um Um. All right. So, what does ad button do? Oh, that's what they have. Did anybody use that? There's 

Isabella Iovino
What? 

You
an ad button at the top left. Like 

Isabella Iovino
Add of top left of 

You
it 

Isabella Iovino
what? 

You
can go to the Instagram profile. 

Isabella Iovino
Oh, hold on, let me go. Oh, that that's to add a post. They keep, and one thing I don't want with this app is how I don't want to be changing things up super often, 

You
I 

Isabella Iovino
and 

You
know. 

Isabella Iovino
like every 

You
Oh. 

Isabella Iovino
month 

You
Yeah. 

Isabella Iovino
there's like a new thing going on. It's so stupid. 

You
You know what the thing is, they're reacting to user feedback. You know, 

Isabella Iovino
Yeah, 

You
like 

Isabella Iovino
but 

You
this, 

Isabella Iovino
like nobody 

You
you're, 

Isabella Iovino
asks for that. 

You
well, you have, you don't. I mean, they have data on it. Like, that's the thing. We don't have any data on our user base. So, like, 

Isabella Iovino
True. 

You
we are doing this based off of what we want, and that's good enough, honestly, because if we have, you know, if that basically means you're just finding a niche, and, uh, 

Isabella Iovino
Yeah. 

You
you know, you don't really need a whole lot. So 

Isabella Iovino
Yeah. 

You
you just get 10 paying users or something like that, you get like 250 bucks a month. You know, like, 

Isabella Iovino
Yeah. 

You
But we just got to figure out how to monetize later. Anyway, let's just keep going to this. 

Isabella Iovino
Okay. Um, how are we gonna do the, like, moving between your profile page and, like, your homepage 

You
Well, 

Isabella Iovino
and the search 

You
Let's, 

Isabella Iovino
page? 

You
uh, I don't know if you, you, I, what else are we putting on this one? Let's finish this one up. And 

Isabella Iovino
Okay, yeah. 

You
then, uh, move move 

Isabella Iovino
Um, 

You
on. 

Isabella Iovino
well, when it when it comes down to actually doing this stuff, I don't want like the boxes. I'm sure that's probably there just now 

You
Yeah, I know. 

Isabella Iovino
as 

You
It's 

Isabella Iovino
like, yeah, okay. 

You
a wire frame. It's just a 

Isabella Iovino
Yeah. 

You
layout of how you want things. And then yeah, we're going to style it 

Isabella Iovino
Shit, 

You
later. 

Isabella Iovino
where, where are we gonna put the follow button? 

You
Where is the follow button on the, I mean, the follow buttons are, okay, you have follow, you can have like a following section, like just a, and then you have this followers following and you can put a follow button here. 

Isabella Iovino
Well, but I don't I don't want all that kind of stuff to be taking up a lot of the profile. Like I said, I want most of it to be like you could see the person's 

You
Ah. 

Isabella Iovino
feed, like their posts. 

You
Okay, 

Isabella Iovino
So I feel 

You
so 

Isabella Iovino
like 

You
I 

Isabella Iovino
that's kind of taking up a 

You
have an 

Isabella Iovino
lot. 

You
idea. I have an idea then. Maybe we can just do um, we can make this float at the bottom. 

Isabella Iovino
Mm, nah, I kind of want it all in one place. I don't know. 

You
Okay. Um, let's see, uh, I mean, I can kind of move this up a bit more. Uh, make it reduce the size of the uh, oh, come on, I 

Isabella Iovino
Yeah. 

You
thought that was locked. It's supposed to be locked. That's annoying. Um, Okay, kind of move this up more. And then like, okay, we want some pictures, right? Like, how do we what kind of grid are we doing here? 

Isabella Iovino
Um... 

You
Like, 

Isabella Iovino
Hmm. 

You
is it, uh, like one or 

Isabella Iovino
Maybe like 

You
like 

Isabella Iovino
four? 

You
two, four? Okay. All 

Isabella Iovino
Uh. I feel like maybe stick to 3 like Instagram. 

You
right. I can freaking. 

Isabella Iovino
But don't make it rectangular. I hate it when they updated it to make it rectangular. I like I like to when it was square. 

You
Rectangular and square. I don't know what the difference is. Uh, 

Isabella Iovino
Okay, so go to 

You
Yeah. 

Isabella Iovino
Instagram and go to 

You
Okay, 

Isabella Iovino
like someone's profile. 

You
uh, let's see. Oh, okay, yeah, I see 

Isabella Iovino
So 

You
it's 

Isabella Iovino
you see 

You
like. 

Isabella Iovino
how the people post? it like a rectangle. You know how it used to be a lot smaller? 

You
Yeah, 

Isabella Iovino
It was like a square. 

You
yeah. 

Isabella Iovino
It was like 

You
Yeah. 

Isabella Iovino
a perfect square. I don't know 

You
All 

Isabella Iovino
why they changed it. don't like it. 

You
right, so let's make them perfect squares. I 

Isabella Iovino
Yep. 

You
don't even know if I can like. I don't know if I can get a perfect square with the software. Uh. Probably around that big. 

Isabella Iovino
Yeah. 

You
Oh, come on. And where do we start, like, right here? 

Isabella Iovino
Um, that's a little too high, I think. I think there needs to be like a little bit of a gap. 

You
Like, uh, And that's actually, that's, that's, it's got to be smaller than this, right? Because it's like, 

Isabella Iovino
Yeah. 

You
You want a 3rd of the screen. It's just probably 

Isabella Iovino
Yeah. 

You
like this much. Try this. 

Isabella Iovino
Wait hold I put my glasses. Oh, there we are. 

You
Pretty good. That's not bad. 

Isabella Iovino
Yeah. Okay, and then. 

You
Yeah. And it just could be, it's just gonna be endless. Like, you just keep scrolling. 

Isabella Iovino
Yeah. 

You
Uh. 

Isabella Iovino
Okay, well, you don't have to make another one. 

You
Oh, I was trying to like make it like, so okay, I guess not. All right. 

Isabella Iovino
Because I'm sure some stuff is probably going to go at the very bottom. 

You
Okay. Oh, so you want like a tab bar kind of thing? 

Isabella Iovino
Yeah, because you want to be able to like flip through like the search area and then like the 

You
Well, Instagram 

Isabella Iovino
homepage. 

You
has like just the back, uh, you can just swipe, uh, and like it has a back button at the left, uh, there's no tab bar, like unless you're on like the, The 

Isabella Iovino
No, there's a tab 

You
home, 

Isabella Iovino
bar. 

You
on the home, like if you're on like the home, How do I explain that? Like, okay, when you go into a profile, there's no tab bar. 

Isabella Iovino
Uh-huh. Uh hold on. Oh, yeah. Well, but when you're on your own profile, there is. 

You
Um, Oh, when you're on your own father is. Interesting. 

Isabella Iovino
Wait, hold on. 

You
Yeah, you're right. 

Isabella Iovino
Wait. Holy shit. Holy shit, wait, wait, wait, 

You
All 

Isabella Iovino
wait. 

You
right. 

Isabella Iovino
There might be the, there might be the ninth secret ninth episode of Stranger Things tomorrow. One of the actors in the show was just on the tonight show and said tomorrow it begins. 

You
Oh boy. 

Isabella Iovino
Holy shit. I swear to God, there better be a ninth episode. Holy shit. 

You
Um. All right, I'm going to pause, I'm going to stop recording.
